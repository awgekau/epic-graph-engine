# ðŸ§  Epic Graph Engine

A dynamic graph implementation in **C**, designed for handling node relationships and weighted edges in large-scale, open-ended systems like story-driven games, simulation engines, or learning tools. Built with dynamic memory allocation and optimized for memory safety using Valgrind.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Directed & weighted graph representation  
- âœ… Supports dynamic node and edge insertion/deletion  
- âœ… Path traversal with edge weight accumulation  
- âœ… Memory leak-safe (Valgrind tested)  
- âœ… Fast adjacency list design  
- âœ… Clean command-based input interface

## ðŸ§© How It Works

This graph engine processes commands via `stdin` or redirected file input. It dynamically manages memory for nodes and edges using adjacency lists. Each node can connect to multiple destinations with associated weights.

## ðŸ’» Commands Supported

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `i <id>` | Insert node |
| `d <id>` | Delete node and all connected edges |
| `l <src> <dst> <weight>` | Link: add or update edge |
| `r <src> <dst>` | Remove edge |
| `n <id>` | Check if node exists |
| `e <src> <dst>` | Check if edge exists |
| `p <id_1> <id_2> ... <id_k>` | Traverse path and sum edge weights |
| `t` | Terminate and free memory |

## ðŸ“¦ Building & Running

### Compile

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -std=c99 src/ex5q1.c -o graph
